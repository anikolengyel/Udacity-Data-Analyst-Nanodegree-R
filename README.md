### Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree: R Exercises

This repository contains a sample collection of my work with R. During Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) program I completed several exercises, solved problem sets and created visualizations. I used R mostly to exploratory data analysis. I analyzed multiple of Udacity's own learning datasets with R, including a customer behavorial data set and pseudo_Facebook data and some of R's built-in datasets, like Diamonds. My most frequent used libraries during these exercises were ggplot2, GGally and gridExtra.
