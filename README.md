### Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree: R Exercises

During Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program I completed several exercises, solved problem sets and created visualizations.
I analyzed multiple of Udacity's own learning datasets with R, including a customer behavorial data set and a pseudo-Facebook 
data set. I also used some of R's built-in datasets, like Diamonds. My most frequent used libraries during my work were 
ggplot2, GGally and gridExtra.
